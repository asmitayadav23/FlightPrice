# FlightPrice

Processed a Kaggle flight price dataset with 10,683 rows and 11 columns, resolving mixed data types and handling null values. Performed feature engineering, expanding the dataset to 15 columns by deriving 4 new features (Departure Time, Arrival Time, Days Left, Stops). Standardized categorical variables, optimized data structure, and ensured consistency for analysis. Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean, transform, and visualize the data, making it suitable for machine learning modeling to predict flight prices effectively.
